When we nest an if inside another if, it is possible that there will be more if
branches than else branches. Indeed, our grading program has four ifs and two
elses. The question arises: How do we know to which if a given else belongs?
This problem, usually referred to as a dangling else, is common to many
programming languages that have both if and if else statements. Different
languages solve this problem in different ways. In C++ the ambiguity is resolved by
specifying that each else is matched with the closest preceding unmatched if.
Programmers sometimes get into trouble when they write code that contains more
if than else branches. To illustrate the problem, we¡¯ll rewrite the innermost
